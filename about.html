			<p>Hi, I'm Matt!</p>
			<p> I'm a 24 year old software developer from a small town called Corfu, just outside of Buffalo, NY. I'm currently seeking work in or around New York City, but I am open to relocating to other major cities as well. After spending some time at a small start-up called ConfigurEx , I moved into a more stable role at one of the leading companies for pharmaceutical analysis and reporting, ValueCentric. While I've learned a lot at ValueCentric, I am currently looking for a new challenge in a bigger city. While I have worked as a full stack developer for my entire career, I am looking to move towards a role as purely a back-end developer. The bulk of my experience lies in Java and ColdFusion development on the back-end, and JavaScript development on the front-end, all while working with either MySql or PL/SQL. Currently, my interests have drawn me towards React/Redux, using it in both my personal and professional work. If your company is looking for a hard working Software Developer who loves a challenge, click the "contact" button at the top of the page! If you'd like to know a little more about me, please keep reading!</p>
			<p>I have been a competitve athlete in one form or another my entire life. In highschool, I ran cross country and was a sprinter on my highschool swim team. My freshman year of college I tried out Competitive Ultimate Frisbee. After a year of playing, the sport and it's community drew me in. I began to move into a leadership position on the team, and by the end of my 4 years at Binghamton, I had served as Vice-President, President, and Captain of the club. I have also played on private club teams in both Buffalo and Rochester. Ultimate is my passion, and I plan to be contributing to the greater Ultimate community for many years to come.</p>
			<p>So thanks for visiting the site and reading a little more about me! If you have any questions, or would like to hear more about my professional experience, please feel free to contact me!
